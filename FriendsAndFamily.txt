My family consists of several unofficial comedians and artists.
Everyone in my family has a musical gift.
I am a physical clone of my father given the fact that I look just like he did, I'm on the same career path, and we share the exact same name.
The friends I grew up knowing all did music with me in school.
These friends have all taken their music production to the next level.
Everyone in my friend group has social media except for me.
